## Description
${answers.description}

This study guide was created to provide basic information to new students learning how to code for the first time. This information helped me as a beginner coder, and I thoughht this information could help other first time coders. 

I learned that the 3 different areas of coding, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play an important role in creating a webpage. Think of each as a differnt step in building a house. HTML would be the building of the frame of a house, CSS would be the decoration and styling of the house, and JavaScript would be the function of the house.
